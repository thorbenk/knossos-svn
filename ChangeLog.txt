=  KNOSSOS V3.2 - Change Log     =
==================================

KNOSSOS is a software tool for the visualization and annotation of 3D image data and was developed for the rapid reconstruction of neural morphology and connectivity.

-  General Information           -
----------------------------------

Release Date: Date 01.09.2012

----------------------------------
-  Bug fixes                     -
----------------------------------

- State of checkboxes show the correct value
- Window sizes stable after main window resizes
- Fixed flickering viewports at coordinates that are multiples of 128
- Fixed jumping to last branch node
- After deleting a tree, the next new node is added to the active tree
- Newly created and saved skeleton files also appear in recent files
- Skeleton file paths containing dots are handled correctly now.
- If default skeleton files folder misses (path/to/knossos/skeletonFiles), it will automatically be created on a save event.
- Titlebar updates correctly when skeleton is cleared.

----------------------------------
-  Features                      -
----------------------------------

- Advanced tracing modes: The user has the possibility to use three different tracing modes:
	Additional viewport direction move mode 
	Additional tracing direction move mode
	Additional mirrored move mode
- Tracing time window shows the KNOSSOS running time, tracing time and idle time
- Users can put comments on [F1] - [F5] shortcuts to easily add them to nodes.
- Added shortcuts
	Go to next/previous node via [x]/[Shift]+[x]
	Go to next/previous tree via [y]/[Shift]+[y]
	Move 10 layers in/against viewport direction via [e]/[r]
	Quit KNOSSOS via [ALT]+[F4]
	Save file via [CTRL]+[s]
	Connect/disconnect nodes via [ALT] + [mouseleft]/[rightclick]
	Change zoom in skeleton viewport via [i]/[o] when mouse is in skeleton viewport
- Reset button in skeleton viewport resets to default view
- Skeleton viewport settings are now saved in skeleton file
- User can load LUT-Files to use own colors for the skeleton trees
- User can restore default preferences
- Physical size of the microscopy data can be shown in the viewports
- Microscopy data can be stored in inverse cube order (z first) on hard drive


----------------------------------
-  Changes                       -
----------------------------------

- Larger field of view of data viewports (displaying twice as much data for M==3 with the same cube loading times) at the expense of a bit less buffering
- Size of viewports adjusted
- Selecting nodes via [Shift]+[left click] is easier than before.
- User has to confirm before he delets a tree
- Limited recentering time to 5 seconds
- Improvements in saving/autosaving skeleton files:
	saving a skeleton without ".nml" will automatically add the extension to the file name
	empty skeleton cannot be saved.
	trying to save an unchanged skeleton asks for confirmation.
- More information is saved in user settings.
- Coordinates delimited by various separators can be read in (pasted from other applications)
- Sliders for bias/range delta
- KNOSSOS launcher and synchroniser updated to be compatible with Phyton 3 (Python 2.x still supported)
- Changing the active tree causes recentering to first node of new active tree.
- Python starter will give a warning when user tries to launch knossos without selecting a dataset.
- Unsucessfully loading a skeleton does not clear the old skeleton, anymore
